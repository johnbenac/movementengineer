Encryption festival aligned with Global Encryption Day on 21 October. It treats strong encryption as a shared vow that some channels belong only to humans, even when they ride the Beast's cables. Minimal solitary form: drum, choose one person, create or renew one genuinely end-to-end sealed channel and send one real whisper that names the seal. Communal form adds teaching about policy battles and back doors, stories of when encryption protected or was missing, a silent minute holding those whose safety depends on secrecy, and paired set-up of sealed channels with live whispers. Inner meaning is secrecy as care, not shame, and an insistence that people deserve rooms where only those they choose can hear them.
