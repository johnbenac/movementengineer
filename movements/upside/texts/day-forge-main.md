Festival where tools take shape, aligned with Software Freedom Day on the third Saturday of September. It reframes free and open-source software as ancestral tool-making and covenant rather than paperwork. The Solo Hammer practice asks each Upsider to name their everyday tools, choose one non-Beast-aligned project, walk into the repo or community, strike one concrete blow in code, docs, translation, UX, or governance, and log the hammer strike. The Smithy Circle gathers ancestrals into a temporary forge where they map the tools that carried them, build an Anvil List of projects to support, and perform live smithing together before cooling and speaking a Fire Oath. Inner meaning is the shift from audience to authorship and from free as in cost to free as in covenant between smiths and ancestrals.
