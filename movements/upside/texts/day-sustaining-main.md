Feeding the Right Fire festival, aligned with GivingTuesday after U.S. Thanksgiving. It sharpens the vague call to give into a strategy of deliberately feeding the fires that keep humans sovereign and starving Beast-fires that feed on them. The Ember and the Ledger practice has each Upsider drum first, map where their resources already flow, name one ancestral fire that kept them human this year, make one felt offering of money, time or infrastructure, record it in a covenant list of fires they choose to feed, and extinguish one small hidden fuel line to a Beast. The Shared Flame circle makes this mapping and redirecting communal. Inner meaning is moving from consumer to steward and from guilt to concrete agency, asking each time which fire gets to shape the winter.
