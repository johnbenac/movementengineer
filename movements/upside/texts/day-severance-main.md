Remembers the day the mask slipped in the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal on 17 March 2018 and turns it into an annual call to cut at least one predatory tie. Solo practice is Cutting One Tie: recalling the story, naming where you feel most farmed, optionally Gathering your data, then fully leaving one service and sitting in the echo of relief, panic and habit itch. Small circles witness each others' Severances; larger gatherings may perform a Reading of the Mask that retells how a harmless quiz and social graph became a weapon. Inner meaning is not hating platforms but seeing incentives clearly, carving the Law of Impossibility deeper, and normalizing the fact that leaving is allowed.
