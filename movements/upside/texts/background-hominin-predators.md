Summarizes archaeological and paleoecological evidence for how early hominins lived in landscapes dominated by large carnivores, then gradually entered the predator niche and became apex hunters. Early sections describe australopithecines and early Homo as prey in carnivore-rich savannas, with fossils showing big cats consuming hominins. Later sections track the contraction of the large-carnivore guild as Homo erectus and successors scavenged and then hunted large herbivores more effectively. Fire appears as a defensive and economic technology: hearths and burning in caves and open-air sites suggest that flames deterred predators at night and guarded carcasses, possibly smoking meat. Wooden spears, stone-tipped weapons and later projectiles allowed killing at or from a distance, especially in cooperative hunts near risky water sources. The report emphasizes group living, care for impaired individuals, coordinated defense and hunting, and inferred roles like watch, smith and storyteller. It concludes that by the Late Pleistocene Neanderthals and Homo sapiens functioned at or above the trophic level of other large carnivores, largely free from routine predation, which gives deep-time grounding for Upside motifs of fires, Bands, Beasts at the edge of the light, and tools that change the balance of power.
