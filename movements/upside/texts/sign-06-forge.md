Describes the move from observer to maker: choosing one project that maintains anti-surveillance tools or open, neutral infrastructure and making one small real contribution to it. Outer form: go where the work happens, introduce yourself, complete one end-to-end contribution and mark down that you took the hammer. Inner meaning: accepting that your hands are now on the tools others use and that you share responsibility for how they evolve. Deepening leads toward stewardship, architecture choices and guarding against drift back into extraction.
