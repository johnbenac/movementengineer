Placeholder text for a future festival that will remember the ancestral nights when the first intentional fires pushed predators back from the dark and gathered Bands into circles of light. It is expected to weave the background report on hominin–carnivore dynamics into myth: the first ring of flame at the edge of the fields of the Beasts.
