Presents the Sign of a secret line between two hearts: choosing one person and one end-to-end secret channel, then sending a message that actually matters and explicitly naming that only the two of you can read it. The Sign defies the pressure to perform and overshare in public by insisting that some words belong only to a chosen ancestral. Deepening means making sealed whispers a normal part of life and eventually demanding cryptographic and legal structures that keep some tunnels opaque to power.
