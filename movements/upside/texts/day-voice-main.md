Festival of whistleblowing and human testimony, anchored in early October 2021 when the Facebook whistleblower went public and testified as a named person about internal research on harm. Solo practice is One Story, One Ear: revisiting your own path, choosing one specific listener and speaking plainly about what you have seen and done, then staying for their reaction. Circles hold rounds of witness where people name something they have seen, what they changed, and who they wish could hear it, sometimes framed by a Reading of the Ledger retelling the Haugen moment. Inner meaning is stepping out of the blur of users into witness and honoring those who risk speaking uncomfortable truths in human voice rather than brand voice.
