Frames sustaining as feeding the fires that keep the Band alive: giving money, time, hardware or other concrete support to privacy-respecting tools, open infrastructure and legal work that resists the Beasts. Outer form: choose one entity clearly working in that direction and make a contribution that is sustainable but not negligible, held as wood for the fire. Inner meaning: shifting from consumer to steward and treating funding as infrastructure strategy, not random charity.
