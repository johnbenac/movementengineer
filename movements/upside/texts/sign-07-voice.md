Centers the act of one human telling another, mouth to ear, what they have seen and done in the fields of the Beasts. Outer form: after walking at least one or two Signs, you choose someone who senses something is wrong with the internet and tell a small honest story about your own path, then stay to hear their response. Inner meaning: refusing to treat this as marketing or growth hacking and trusting that person-to-person witness cracks the mask more deeply than viral posts.
