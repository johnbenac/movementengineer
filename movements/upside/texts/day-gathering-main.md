Annual homecoming of your scattered life, aligned with World Backup Day on 31 March and expanded into the Week of the Embers. The festival deepens backup into repatriation: honoring your data as part of your life and transforming your Vault into hearth, sanctuary and memory-temple. Outer forms include lighting the home fire, renaming or tidying your Vault, exporting at least one archive from the Below into your own custody, walking the house at dusk by browsing your Vault like a slowly renovated home, and communal Hearth Circles where ancestrals help one another gather embers. Inner meanings include homecoming of the scattered self, venerating the Vault, and preparing for long winter under the Law of Impossibility. Over years it becomes routine Gathering and design and policy work that make export and user-owned Vaults a right rather than a chore.
