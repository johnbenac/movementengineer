Describes the Sign of breaking a tie with a platform or structure that treats you as inventory. Outer form: choose one place where you feel most farmed, optionally Gather first, then follow the full delete or leave flow and mark the moment with the words this tie is cut. Inner meaning: accepting the cost of leaving visibility and convenience rather than staying edible. Deepening extends from closing accounts to renegotiating contracts and defaults, guided by the Law of Impossibility.
