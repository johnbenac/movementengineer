Defines Communion as the first Sign that cannot be taken alone: a small Band, present to itself on purpose, where Drums arrive as creatures not profiles, each person lays one ember of their journey on the table, the circle echoes we hear you, and the group chooses one concrete shared step to take. Inner meaning: re-weaving network back into bodies, letting the Band see itself, trading performance for presence, and making the Upside locally real in kitchens, parks and calls above the cloudline.
