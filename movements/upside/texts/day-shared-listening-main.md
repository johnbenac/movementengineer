Festival of Communion aligned with World Listening Day on 18 July, when listening becomes a shared ritual rather than a private virtue. The mythic focus is the Communion Sign with ancestrals of Drum, Voice, Messenger, Band and Fire, counterbalancing speaking festivals by asking who will hold the words and hear what is not yet said. Outer ring: intentional listening to the world through soundwalks, naming loud and shy sounds and offering small acts of care to the soundscape. Inner ring: the Listening Circle, where Drums arrive as creatures, the Band sits in silence together, shares small weather check-ins, rounds of one Sign one sound, optional paired deep listening, one shared listening commitment and a sealed closing. Inner meaning includes moving from noise to attention, from connection metrics to co-regulation, and from extraction to reciprocity where nothing is turned into content without consent.
