Introduces the first and oldest Sign: placing a hand on the heartbeat, feeling thud… thud… thud…, and remembering that before feeds, names and metrics there is a creature with a drum in its chest. The outer form is simple breath and pulse awareness; the inner meaning is refusing to be only a user or a data point. Deepening means using the Drum as a prelude to other Signs and as a quiet test before choices: does this serve the creature, or feed the thing that feeds on it?
