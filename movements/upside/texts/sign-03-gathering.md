Defines Gathering as exporting your data from a platform and storing it where you control it, not because you love backups but because you are bringing your own past home. Outer form: choose a platform that holds a lot of your history, find the export function, request the full archive and store it under your own roof with a meaningful name. Inner meaning: your past is not trash or pure marketing inventory. Deepening extends Gathering into more domains and into curation, choosing what to keep, encrypt, burn, or print.
